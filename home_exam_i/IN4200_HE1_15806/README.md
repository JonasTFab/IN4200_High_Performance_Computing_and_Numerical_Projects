# create_connectivity_file.c

You can create your own random generated connectivity graph by running this script. The script requires two inputs, that is the total number of nodes and the total number of unique edges. An example of running the script is shown below.

```bash
$ gcc create_connectivity_file.c
$ ./a.out 5 8
```
This command will create a text file with five nodes and eight egdes. The connectivity is random generated but you can add an additional third argument to give the RNG a seed. Below is a generated connectivity file by using a seed of 0.


```bash
# Undirected graph: connectivity_graph.txt
# Authored by a IN4200 student. The connectivity-graph file is generated randomly based on the number of nodes and the number of edges. 
# Nodes: 5 Edges: 8
# FromNodeId ToNodeId
4  1
3  4
0  1
3  1
2  3
1  2
3  0
4  0
```
